o FP?
  o functional programming a style of programming
  o function language: supports and encourages the functional style

# fp.3
1930s: lambda calculus, Alonzo Church, Alan Turing
1950s: John McCarthy, Lisp, retaining variable assignments
1960s: ISWIM by Peter Landin, first pure functional language, no assignmnets
1970s: FP by John Backus, emphasizes higher-order functions and reasoning about programs
        invented FORTRAN
       ML by Robin Milner, introduced type inference and polimorphic types
1970s-1980s: Miranda system by David Turner, lazy functional languages, Haskell is also a lazy language
1987: Haskell, a standard lazy function language
1990s: Phil Wadler, type classes and monads
2003: Haskell Report by the committee, 2010 updated.

? test qsort

# fp.4
cheat sheet
index start with 0  ref. R/SAS/python
0 is the identity of addition
product [] is 1
f a + b means (f a) + b
Haskell Scripts: with .hs suffix
Function and argument names must begin with a lower-case letter.
List arguments usually have an s suffix on their name.
Layout Rule: a sequence of definitions, each definition must begin in precisely the same column.
Layout rule avoids the need for explicit syntax to indicate the grouping of definitions, for example C.

Exercise 3,
mylast xs = xs !! (length xs - 1)

? exercise 4,5
